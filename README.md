# Linear_Regression_Model
A simple Linear Regression Model
The given Program performs linear regression analysis to predict home prices based on the area (in square feet). 
1.	Import the required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model.
2.	Read the data from a CSV file named "homeprices.csv" and assign it to the df 
3.	Initialize an empty DataFrame named df.
4.	Create a scatter plot using Matplotlib to visualize the relationship between the 'Area' and 'Price' columns.
5.	Create a LinearRegression model.
6.	Fit the model using the 'Area' column as the input (independent variable) and the 'Price' column as the output (dependent variable). 
7.	Predict the price for a given area
